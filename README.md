# I. About the Project

## 1.1. Introduction

In today’s dynamic retail environment, management of inventory, sales, and customer information is immensely important as it supports us in applying appropriate business strategies to ensure the effectiveness of day-to-day operations and create successful results. Therefore, the project Bike Store Information Management System is created with a view to streamline these essential aspects of the bike store.
This project is developed using MySQL to enhance the management of bike store operations, ensuring the quality of our services and products. By centralizing and organizing data related to inventory, sales, and customer interactions , the project‘s primary goal is to minimize manual efforts while maximizing operational efficiency and productivity in every aspect of bike store management. Furthermore, through the project, we want to improve decision-making processes, and ultimately drive the growth of the bike store.

- Develop a database recording information about customers, orders, stores and products.
- Deliver a usser-friendly and robust platform for optimizing store operations and information managements.
- Provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making activities.

# II. System Design Analysis

This management system project is developed on a database named `Bike Store` containing nine tables: `customers`, `staffs`, `orders`, `order_items`, `stores`, `products`, `categories`, `brands`, `stocks`. The two columns `total_amount` in `orders` table and `loyalty_point` in `customers` table are added in some specific trigger modules, so it will not appear in creating table and other stored procedures modules. These tables and their structures are given below.
